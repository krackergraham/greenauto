                    <h2>Why Green</h2>

                    <p>It used to be that eco-friendly and auto detail were never used in the same sentence.
                        Believe
                        it
                        or not,
                        there are detail shops and dealerships that use harsh chemicals and solvents to clean
                        interiors.
                        This
                        practice leaves behind products that gas off and can damage plastics and strip leather
                        of
                        its
                        natural
                        oils. Our specially formulated plastic and leather cleaner will clean and condition
                        without
                        harsh
                        chemicals. Confidence in our process, equipment, products and service enables us to
                        offer
                        you a
                        better
                        clean.</p>
