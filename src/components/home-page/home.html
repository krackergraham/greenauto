            <h2>Why Green</h2>

            <p>It used to be that eco-friendly and auto detail were never used in the same sentence. Believe it or not,
                there are detail shops and dealerships that use harsh chemicals and solvents to clean interiors. This
                practice leaves behind products that gas off and can damage plastics and strip leather of its natural
                oils. Our specially formulated plastic and leather cleaner will clean and condition without harsh
                chemicals. Confidence in our process, equipment, products and service enables us to offer you a better
                clean.</p>
